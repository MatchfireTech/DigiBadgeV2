To view and edit the PCB, the PCBWeb program is required. It is free and available at http://www.pcbweb.com

Be aware the DigiBadge does not have a voltage regulator! Safe voltage for the SD card is not to exceed 3.6v. If no SD card is present, voltage can safely go to 5v. This means your standard 1.2v rechargeable batteries should work just fine. The badge is programmed to shut down at 2.5 volts, as below that threshold, the screen is too dark to see.
