Be aware the DigiBadge does not have a voltage regulator! Safe voltage for the SD card is not to exceed 3.6v. If no SD card is present, voltage can safely go to 5v. This means your standard 1.2v rechargeable batteries should work just fine. The Brow-Out Detection (BOD) fuse is set to 1.8v, to allow for longer battery life. SD Card functionality may be impacted as battery voltage lowers, as SD Card rated voltage is between 2.7 and 3.6v
